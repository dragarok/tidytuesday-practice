# tidytuesday-practice
Analysis of tidytuesday dataset using dplyr and ggplot mostly.

You can check the org files as well as html files.
I am new to R as well as data analysis. I hope to teach and learn at the same time and get relevant feedback. 
Feel free to communicate and point out anything I could improve on.
